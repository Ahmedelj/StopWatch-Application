# StopWatch-Application
 I designed and implemented a Stopwatch application with the following features: 

### Features ###
- Start/Stop Functionality: The stopwatch can be started to begin counting time and stopped to pause the timer.

- Lap Recording: The application allows the user to record laps by pressing the dedicated lap button. Each lap is displayed in a list with its corresponding timing.

- Reset: Users can reset the stopwatch to zero, clearing the elapsed time and lap record.
